# ROCK-VS-MINE-PREDICTION
This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify whether a given sample is a rock or a mine based on sonar data. The model is trained to distinguish between rocks and mines using supervised learning technique as Logistic Regression, and it is applied to achieve optimal accuracy.
